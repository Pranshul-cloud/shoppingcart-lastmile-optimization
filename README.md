**PROJECT BACKGROUND( WHY ?)**

ShoppingCart, a leading e-commerce firm, experienced a 15% rise in last-mile delivery costs over Q4 2024, primarily due to traffic delays, failed drop-offs, and inefficient route planning. These challenges led to missed delivery windows, increased fuel consumption, and a decline in customer satisfaction. As order volumes grew during the peak holiday season, delivery performance deteriorated, straining operations and threatening the companyâ€™s scalability.

_Executive Summary(WHAT)_

ShoppingCart, a leading e-commerce platform, experienced a 15% rise in last-mile delivery costs, which made up 52% of total logistics spend, due to traffic congestion, adverse weather, and inefficient routing in metro areas. Average delivery times reached 200 minutes during peak hours, with 40% of routes impacted by severe congestion. In response, a data-driven optimization framework was developed, incorporating smart routing algorithms, dynamic delivery slot scheduling, and traffic-aware planning. Simulation analysis indicated significant potential to streamline delivery operations, reduce transit times, and enhance both efficiency and customer satisfaction at scale.
