**PROJECT BACKGROUND( WHY ?)**

ShoppingCart, a leading e-commerce firm, experienced a 15% rise in last-mile delivery costs over Q4 2024, primarily due to traffic delays, failed drop-offs, and inefficient route planning. These challenges led to missed delivery windows, increased fuel consumption, and a decline in customer satisfaction. As order volumes grew during the peak holiday season, delivery performance deteriorated, straining operations and threatening the company’s scalability.


**Executive Summary(WHAT)**

ShoppingCart, a leading e-commerce platform, experienced a 15% rise in last-mile delivery costs, which made up 52% of total logistics spend, due to traffic congestion, adverse weather, and inefficient routing in metro areas. Average delivery times reached 200 minutes during peak hours, with 40% of routes impacted by severe congestion. In response, a data-driven optimization framework was developed, incorporating smart routing algorithms, dynamic delivery slot scheduling, and traffic-aware planning. Simulation analysis indicated significant potential to streamline delivery operations, reduce transit times, and enhance both efficiency and customer satisfaction at scale.



**PROJECT SCOPE**
1  **Objective**
 To improve the efficiency of ShoppingCart’s last mile delivery operations by analyzing historical delivery ata and developing optimized routing strategies that reduce delivery time and operational costs.

2  **In-Scope Activities** Analyze historical delivery data to identify inefficiencies in existing routes and delivery patterns.
 Design and simulate optimized delivery routes using rule-based or algorithmic approaches (e.g., shortest path, time windows).

3  **Out of Scope**
 Development of mobile applications or driver-facing interfaces.   
 Real-time integration with ShoppingCart’s live delivery or logistics systems.

4  **Deliverables**
A structured Stakeholder Analysis 
A  set of interactive and visual charts analyzing key performance areas in last-mile delivery
A structured business Impact Table
