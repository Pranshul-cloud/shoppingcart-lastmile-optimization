**PROJECT SCOPE**

1  **Objective**
 + To improve the efficiency of ShoppingCart’s last mile delivery operations by analyzing historical delivery ata and developing optimized routing strategies that reduce delivery time and operational costs.

2  **In-Scope Activities**
 + Analyze historical delivery data to identify inefficiencies in existing routes and delivery patterns.
 + Design and simulate optimized delivery routes using rule-based or algorithmic approaches (e.g., shortest path, time windows).

3  **Out of Scope**
 + Development of mobile applications or driver-facing interfaces.   
 + Real-time integration with ShoppingCart’s live delivery or logistics systems.

4  **Deliverables**
+ A structured Stakeholder Analysis 
+ A  set of interactive and visual charts analyzing key performance areas in last-mile delivery
+ A structured business Impact Table
+ A structured Table of Recommendation

   **TOP 3 STAKEHOLDER**

1 **Leadership**
+ **Role:** Sets strategic direction, approves key initiatives, and aligns cross-functional teams
+ **WHY?**  Has highest authority and influence — can accelerate or block project decisions

2 **Finance**
+ **Role:** Manages cost control, budgeting, and efficiency analysis related to logistics spending.
+ **WHY?**  Holds budget authority — any proposed optimization (e.g., new tools, route simulations) needs financial approval.

3 **Operations** 
+ **Role:** Oversees day-to-day delivery operations, manages routing, vehicle allocation, and delivery timelines.
+ **WHY?**  Directly responsible for execution of last-mile delivery.








     

**REQUIREMENTS-**   **(BRD AND FRD ARE AVAILABLE IF REQUIRED)**

**Functional Requirements** 

(1) Traffic Pattern Analysis for Route Optimization The system must analyze historical and real-time traffic data to identify peak congestion periods and common bottlenecks, enabling data-informed routing decisions.

(2) Delivery Time Estimation ModelThe platform must generate predictive delivery time estimates based on factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and traffic flow using machine learning or regression models.

(3) Dynamic Delivery Slot RecommendationBased on analysis of past delivery performance and customer location data, the system must recommend optimal delivery time slots that balance efficiency and customer preference.

**Non-Functional Requirements** **(Achievable via Data Analysis)**

(1) Data Accuracy and Integrity The data pipelines and analytical models must maintain at least 95% accuracy in traffic and delivery time predictions, validated against historical performance benchmarks.

(2) Model Interpretability and Monitoring All predictive models must include transparent evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) and must be re-evaluated monthly to ensure sustained performance and reliability.

**Insight Objectives**


The objective of this analysis is to extract actionable insights from key operational challenges affecting last-mile delivery performance. Each chart targets a specific area of concern to help drive data-backed decision-making:

1  **Late Deliveries Analysis:**
dentify the frequency and impact of late deliveries to understand how they affect customer satisfaction and service quality.

2  **Root Cause Breakdown:**
Examine underlying factors (e.g., vehicle mismatch, traffic) contributing to inefficiency and delayed deliveries.

3  **Impact of Traffic on Route Efficiency:**
Assess how varying traffic levels influence the Route Efficiency Score (RES), highlighting the need for dynamic routing strategies.

4  **Impact of Weather on Route Efficiency:**
Evaluate how different weather conditions affect delivery performance, to support better scheduling and risk management
